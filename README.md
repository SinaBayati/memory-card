# Memory Card Game 

This game is implemented as a part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card). In this game you must click on a card but be careful not to 
click on the same card twice! The game plays 5 rounds and shows your current score and best score.

You can [see the live demo here](https://memory-card-pi-three.vercel.app/).
